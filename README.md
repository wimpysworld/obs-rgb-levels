# RGB Levels Filter

This is a plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that adds a simple
simple effects filter to adjust RGB channels independently. Useful for
correcting poor quality webcams or used in conjunction with other filters to
create special effects ✨

## Requirements

- OBS Studio 31.0.0 or newer

## History

It is the continuation of the original [obs-rgb-levels-filter](https://github.com/petrifiedpenguin/obs-rgb-levels-filter)
plugin by [petrifiedpenguin](https://github.com/petrifiedpenguin), wrapped in
the [OBS Plugin Template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate) so
that it builds 🧱 from source against current versions of OBS Studio.

**This project is only tested on Linux 🐧**.
It is built and released for Windows 🪟 and macOS 🍏 and should work fine, if it doesn't patches are welcome 🩹

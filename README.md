# RGB Levels Filter

This is a plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that adds a simple
simple effects filter to adjust RGB channels independently. Useful for
correcting poor quality webcams or used in conjunction with other filters to
create special effects ✨

It is the continuation of the original [obs-rgb-levels-filter](https://github.com/petrifiedpenguin/obs-rgb-levels-filter)
plugin by [petrifiedpenguin](https://github.com/petrifiedpenguin), wrapped in
the [OBS Plugin Template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate) so
that it builds 🧱 from source against current versions of OBS Studio.

**This project is a work in progress**, it builds for Linux and is included in
[OBS Studio Portable](https://github.com/wimpysworld/obs-studio-portable) but
macOS and Windows need some work 🩹
